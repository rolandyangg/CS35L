C-h k C-h k pulls up the documentation for the command "C-h k" which is the "command describe-key". 
This happens because the C-h k command pulls up the documentation for a command, and we ask it to pull up the documentation for the command itself (C-h k).

C-h k M-SPC pulls up the documentation for the command "M-SPC" which is the command for "just-one-space".
This happens because we call the C-h k command which pulls up the documentation for a command and ask it to pull up the documentation for the command "M-SPC".
M-SPC works by deleting all the spaces and tabs around a POINT, leaving only one space (ex. if there's a bunch of extra tabs or spaces, it truncates the extra whitespace and turns it into one space)

(cycle-spacing n nil 'single-shot)
[NOTE: for it to function similar to M-SPC, n in the function above is equivalent to 1]
To evaluate on buffer can use M-: or M-x eval-expression

Homework: Python scripting)

In python2 randline.py gets an IndexError trying to access an index out of range for /dev/null

In python3 randline.py gets a Syntax Error on line 65 "except IOError as (errno, strerror):" attempting to catch the exception for /dev/null
This is because the syntax for catching exceptions has slightly different rules between Python 2 and Python 

shuf.py NOTE: For my implementation of shuf.py, "-" or a zero for the non-option argument will trigger the stdin option, however a zero argument with -e or -i will have -e or -i take precedence
To mimic the behavior of the GNU version closely, combining -e and -i will create an error, and combining any stdin option with -e or -i will have -e or -i take precedence over it respectfully.

In python2, my shuf.py script exhibits the same behavior as it does in python3... This is because my script is backwards compatible?
